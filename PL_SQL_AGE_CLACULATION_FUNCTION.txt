	AGE CALCULATION FUNCTION IN PL/SQL

	I will try my best to build these functions on the basis of return in all cases to avoid error return. Therefore not sure or might be a slim possibility of non-returning.


	CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION CLACULATE_AGE(DATE_OF_BIRTH VARCHAR2)
	RETURN VARCHAR2
	IS
	CHANGE_IN_DATE DATE;
	AGE VARCHAR2(100);
	BEGIN
	IF CHANGE_IN_DATE NOT IN (TO_DATE(CHANGE_IN_DATE, 'DD-MON-RRRR'))
	THEN
	CHANGE_IN_DATE:=null;
	AGE:='PLEASE PROVIDE FORMAT = DD-MON-RRRR';
	RETURN(AGE);
	ELSIF DATE_OF_BIRTH IS NULL 
	THEN
	CHANGE_IN_DATE:=null;
	AGE:='PLEASE PROVIDE FORMAT = DD-MON-RRRR';
	RETURN(AGE);
	ELSE
	BEGIN
	CHANGE_IN_DATE:=TO_DATE(DATE_OF_BIRTH);
	SELECT ROUND ( (SYSDATE - TO_DATE (CHANGE_IN_DATE) ) /365, 2 ) 
	INTO 
	AGE
	FROM DUAL;
	RETURN(AGE);
	EXCEPTION
	WHEN OTHERS THEN 
	AGE:='PLEASE PROVIDE FORMAT =  DD-MON-RRRR';
	RETURN(AGE);
	END;
	END IF;
	END;


	Calling through SQL query with different criteria
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE('') AGE FROM DUAL
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE('10-jul') AGE FROM DUAL
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE('10') AGE FROM DUAL
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE('10-jul') AGE FROM DUAL
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE('16-july-1981') AGE FROM DUAL
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE('16-jul-1981') AGE FROM DUAL
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE('ABC') AGE FROM DUAL
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE('123') AGE FROM DUAL


	please do not use the following
	SELECT CLACULATE_AGE() AGE FROM DUAL
	as function accept argumet in varchar2 so instead of said use as mentioned above in null quotes.



	IF calling through forms we have control on accurate input provide to function before calling but other modes might not therefore by keeping all facts that has been made.
