				User defined PL/SQL functions Scope, Limitation, Usage and disadvantages

 	

		"Once function created it can be invoke through sql query."
		
		On the basis of above statement we will discuss three main topics as under:-

		1. Scope:-
			Function can be useful for compute values from database tables and without tables.
			IN parameter/s are part of it but not necessary, Out parameter is mandatory to retrieve value.


		2. Limitations:-
			Do not use for DML or any operation that update values in Database as out limit thing. We have procedure for the same purpose later discuss it.
			Do not use exception section here we can do it but again out limit thing here.
                        

		
		3. Usage:-
			Functions calling area are, sql queries on Oracle SQL, Oracle Forms and Reports functions, PL/SQL scope.
			Function can through no value in various case which should be handled properly. So we have to set our meaningful usage.

	
			
		Example:-1
			
		Now consider following function:-

		CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION GET_CONTENTS(REQ_TYPE VARCHAR2) 
		RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
		L_RESULT VARCHAR2(150);
		BEGIN
	 	IF REQ_TYPE = 'OSUSER' THEN
	 	select sys_context('userenv','os_user')os_user INTO L_RESULT  from dual;
	 	END IF;
	 	RETURN L_RESULT;
		END
		/

		select GET_CONTENTS('OSUSER') FROM DUAL;	


		Above is simple function in which define to get OS name by passing parameter='OSUSER' we will get output against it. Try yourself.


		
			
			
		Example:- 2

		CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ERP.GET_SYSTEM_NAME
   		RETURN VARCHAR2
   		-- CREATED BY AWAIS ASLAM 
		IS
   		v_OSNAME    VARCHAR2 (4000);
 		BEGIN
 		SELECT sys_context('USERENV', 'OS_USER') INTO V_OSNAME FROM DUAL  ;
       		RETURN v_OSNAME;
  		EXCEPTION
   		WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND
   		THEN
      		v_OSNAME := ' ';
      		return v_OSNAME;
		END;
		/	
			
		select GET_CONTENTS('OSUSER') FROM DUAL;
		

		In this example we define to get OS name without passing any parameter but output comes. Try yourself.


		Scope of above example is useful when working as Database Developer but on front end function scope died as we have webutil library.

		I will going to broaden functions more in next coming
