
Scenario 1:-

Suppose we need to find out divisible of any number, let assume what are the divisible of 3.

In SQL we will use following function to find out the specific number with 2

select mod(10,3) from dual;

-- mod(10,3) argument 10 has been checked in table 3, if perfectly divisible then query return 0 otherwise number greater than 0.

Nice solution for single number check.




Scenario 2:-

Let consider what numbers are perfectly divisible by 3, number ranges 1-100. Now at that occasion use of single row query is not workable.

Ans:- So what method should we adapt to get solution, we begin to utilize anonymous block process.

Begin 
 For i in 1..100 loop
 if mod(i,3) = 0 then
 dbms_output.put_line(i ||'  ' || 'Divisible by 3');
 else
 dbms_output.put_line(i);
 end if;
  end loop;
 end;

Output is according to our need.
